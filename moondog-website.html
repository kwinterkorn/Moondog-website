      <img src="img/Moondog-driving.jpg" alt="Moondog driving">
        <li><strong>Drive in automobiles</strong><br> I get to drive in the car sometimes and I prefer to stick my head out of the passenger's
        window when possible to bark at other dogs.  I also like putting my paw on the driver or the stick shift according <tbody>
          my preferences at the time.
        </li>

      <li><strong>Play with Pretty Boy Roy</strong><br>
      Pretty boy is my friend from down the street.  We like to mouth each other's faces and play tug of war with sticks.</li>
    </div>

    <div class="col-md-4">
      <img src="img/Neighborhood-photo.jpg" alt="Photo of neighborhood">
      <li><strong>Take a walk around my bucholic neighborhood</strong><br>
      I really like going on walks and I'm generally pretty happy to sit on the corner before proceding into the crosswalk,
    unless it's raining.  I get so excited when I see other dogs, that I bounce around and breath heavily.  Mostly I just want to greet them.</li>
